## Usage

```bash
git-cleaner-tui
# or: git-cleaner-tui --repo /path/to/repo
```

### Branches Tab

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Toggle selection |
| `a` | Select / deselect all |
| `d` | Delete selected (with confirmation) |
| `r` | Toggle remote deletion |
| `p` | Toggle protected visibility |
| `b` | Toggle blacklisted visibility |
| `u` | Undo last deletion batch |
| `Ctrl+R` | Refresh |
| `Ctrl+B` | Open bookmarks |

Date presets (7d/30d/90d/1y) sit next to the Load button. Branches appear grouped by prefix in a collapsible Tree. Select a leaf node to see its last-commit details.

### Maintenance Tab

Health stats and one‑click tasks: Git GC, GC Aggressive, Repack, Prune Remote, Expire Reflog, or Run All (sequential). Runs async — UI stays responsive.

### Stashes Tab

DataTable of all stashes with Drop / Apply / Pop / Refresh buttons.

### Bookmarks

`Ctrl+B` opens a modal to add the current repo, remove it, or switch to a bookmarked repo. Persisted in `~/.git-branch-cleaner.toml`.

---

## Configuration

`~/.git-branch-cleaner.toml` (global) or `.git-branch-cleaner.toml` (per‑repo):

```toml
[protected]
patterns = ["release/*", "hotfix/*"]

[blacklist]
patterns = ["archive/*", "wip-*"]

[theme]
name = "textual-dark"
```

Hardcoded defaults (always active): `main`, `master`, `develop`. The checked-out branch is also protected.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I undo a deletion?**  
Yes — press `u` immediately after deleting. Undo uses `git branch <name> <hash>` via the stored commit hash.

**Q: Does it work on Windows?**  
Yes. Tested on Windows, macOS, Linux. Python 3.11+.

**Q: How are dates filtered?**  
By the commit date of the branch tip. Both From and Until are inclusive.

**Q: Does the maintenance dashboard modify my repo?**  
It runs real git commands that modify `.git`. They don't change working tree files.
